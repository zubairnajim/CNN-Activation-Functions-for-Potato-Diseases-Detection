Systematic Evaluation of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Activation Functions for Potato Disease Detection
Abstract:
Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is a globally important staple crop, but its production is severely threatened by diseases such as Black Scurf, Blackleg, and Pink Rot, which can cause significant yield losses and economic damage. For example, potato diseases have been reported to reduce yields by up to 20-30% in some regions, translating into billions of dollars in losses annually worldwide. Early and accurate detection of these diseases is therefore critical to prevent spread and mitigate damage. Deep learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has emerged as a powerful tool for automated plant disease identification due to its ability to learn complex visual patterns from images. This study systematically evaluates eight state-of-the-art CNN architectures combined with six modern activation functions (e.g., ReLU, Mish, GELU) to identify the most effective model-activation pairs for classifying seven common potato conditions, including healthy and diseased classes. Using a publicly validated dataset from the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute, results show that EfficientNet and DenseNet architectures paired with advanced activations like GELU and Mish achieve superior classification accuracy, highlighting their potential for robust agricultural disease monitoring systems
